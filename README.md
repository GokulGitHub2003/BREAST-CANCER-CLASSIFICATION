# BREAST-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION

TITLE
Breast Cancer Classification as bening or Malignant

DESCRIPTION
In this repository I have attached the code for building an end to end model fro the breast cancer classification dataset


PROBLEM STATEMENT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. 
It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.
The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).
The Task is to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.


DATASET
I got this dataset from the kaggle's repository
Link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/breast-cancer-dataset


TECK STACKS
1.Pandas
2.Numpy
3.Seaborn
4.Matplotlib.pyplot
5.Python-version - 3.10.10


ENVIRONMENT
1.Jupyter Notebook
2.Visual Studio Code


INSTRUCTION
1.First import all the required libraries as i mentioned in the requirements.txt
2.Load the dataset in the working environment.
3.Preprocess the data.
4.Split and train the model.
5.The model used here is SVM.
6.Then using the pickle dump the model.
7.Load the model using pickle.
8.Now open a new environment in the VS code and upload your notebook.
9.Create a new file called app.py and make connection with html
10.Create a new file called index.html and u can make the ui as u want.
11.Then open the terminal of the VS Code and strat running app.py in it.
12.The page will be executed in the default localhost:5000.
